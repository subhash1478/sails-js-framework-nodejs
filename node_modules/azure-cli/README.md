## Installation

### Install from npm

You can install the azure-cli npm package directly.
```bash
npm install -g azure-cli
```

### Install on Ubuntu
The Xplat-CLI requires Node.js. Installation varies slightly by Ubuntu version.

**Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr**

On Ubuntu 14, the Node.js package is called nodejs-legacy. The npm package is installed first to get the Node Package Manager used to install the CLI.

```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g azure-cli
```
**Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin**

On Ubuntu 12, the version of Node.js available in the default package manager is too old. You can use the Personal Package Archive feature to install the current binary distribution. First, install the curl package to easily retrieve the install script.

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g azure-cli
```

### Pre-compiled installers

* [Windows](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=254279)
* [Mac](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=252249) 
* [Linux](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=253472)

### Download Source Code

You can also install the Azure Xplat-CLI from sources using **git**  and **npm**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli.git
cd ./azure-xplat-cli
npm install
```

### Configure auto-complete

Auto-complete is supported for Mac and Linux.

To enable it in zsh, run:

```bash
echo '. <(azure --completion)' >> .zshrc
```

To enable it in bash, run:

```bash
azure --completion >> ~/azure.completion.sh
echo 'source ~/azure.completion.sh' >> .bash_profile
```

## Get Started

* First, get authenticated with Microsoft Azure. For details, read [this article](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/).
  * Option 1: Login with your Organizational account. Azure Active Directory authentication is used in this case. No management certificate is needed. **Note**: Authentication with a Microsoft account is not supported at this time. You can create a free Organizational account in the Azure portal for use in the CLI.
  * Option 2: Download and import a publish settings file which contains a management certificate.

If you use both mechanisms on the same subscription, Azure Active Directory authentication will be used by default. If you want to go back to management certificate authentication, please use ``azure logout``, which will remove the Azure Active Directory information and bring management certificate authentication back in.

#### Login directly from xplat-cli (Azure Active Directory authentication)

```bash
# This will prompt for your password in the console
azure login -u <your organizational ID email address>

# use the commands to manage your services/applications
azure site create --location "West US" mywebsite
```

#### Use publish settings file (Management certificate authentication)

```bash
# Download a file which contains the publish settings information of your subscription.
# This will open a browser window and ask you to log in to get the file.
azure account download

# Import the file you just downloaded.
# Notice that the file contains credential of your subscription so you don't want to make it public
# (like check in to source control, etc.).
azure account import <file location>

# Use the commands to manage your services/applications
azure site create --location "West US" mywebsite
```

### azure cli on Ubuntu
If you want to run xplat cli on Ubuntu, then you should install **nodejs-legacy** instead of **nodejs**. For more information please check the following links:
- [why there is a problem with nodejs installation on ubuntu](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14914715/express-js-no-such-file-or-directory/14914716#14914716)
- [how to solve the nodejs installation problem on ubuntu](https://github.com/expressjs/keygrip/issues/7)

Please perform the installation steps in following order:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g azure-cli
```

## 2 Modes

Starting from 0.8.0, we are adding a separate mode for Resource Manager. You can use the following command to switch between the

* Service management: commands using the Azure service management API
* Resource manager: commands using the Azure Resource Manager API

They are not designed to work together.

```bash
azure config mode asm # service management
azure config mode arm # resource manager
```

**For more details on the commands, please see the [command line tool reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252246&clcid=0x409) and this [How to Guide](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/)**

## Docker

Usage is same as standard vm create.

    azure vm docker create [options] <dns-name> <image> <user-name> [password]

This command only supports Ubuntu 14.04 based images. Docker is configured on the VM using HTTPS as described here: http://docs.docker.io/articles/https/ By default, certificates are put in `~/.docker`, and Docker is configured to run on port 4243. These can be configured using new options:

    -dp, --docker-port [port]              Port to use for docker [4243]
    -dc, --docker-cert-dir [dir]           Directory containing docker certs [.docker/]
	
After the VM is created. It can be used as a Docker host with the `-H` option or `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable.

    docker --tls -H tcp://<my-host>.cloudapp.net:4243 run

Note: To run docker commands on windows make sure ssl agent is installed.
	
## Setting up Fiddler for CLI

You need to set the following environment variables to capture the HTTP traffic generated from the execution of xplat cli commands

```bash
set NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888
```
## Want to know the underlying HTTP traffic when you execute the command
You can use the -vv option to see the actual REST requests on the console.
```bash
azure site create --location "West US" mytestsite -vv
```

## Running Tests

See [this page for instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli/wiki/Running-Tests) that describe how to run the test suite.
